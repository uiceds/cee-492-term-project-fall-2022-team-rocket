## Plan
The A-scan data is categorized into three classes based on the delamination conditions. Fast Fourier transform of the A-scans will be performed to obtain the peak frequency and peak width. These values will act as independent variables in the machine learning model to predict the delamination condition. The bridge health at each location where an A-scan is collected is categorized into three classes: Class 1 No delamination, Class 2 Delamination (above the top bar mat), and Class 3 Delamination (below the top bar mat). Around 10,000 labeled A-scans will be used to train the model and 3000 labeled A-scans will be utilized for validation. Later, the trained model will be tested on 3000 A-scans to predict the delamination condition. Finally, B-scans will be generated and deck conditions at different locations of the bridge will be predicted.
