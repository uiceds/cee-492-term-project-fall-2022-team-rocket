## Predictive Modeling

<div style="text-align: justify">Based on the exploratory data analysis it can be concluded that the differentiation of the classes is challenging. The analytical approach to determining key features for distinguishing different classes is not conclusive and overall, the data delineation is not observed. Hence, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) will be used to classify the delamination into three categories. The dataset will be divided into three parts with approximately 60 % of the data used for training, 20 % for validation and 20 % for testing. The raw A-scans will be given as input to the CNN network and will be trained for the expected outcomes in terms of different delamination classes. </div> 

<div style="text-align: justify">Furthermore, the input parameters from our exploratory data analysis (maximum amplitude in time and frequency domain, PCA modes, etc.) will be used to create a machine-learning model for the prediction of the delamination category of the A-scan taken by GPR. Both models will be compared with each other in terms of accuracy and precision.</div>
